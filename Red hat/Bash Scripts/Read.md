 **READ**

Script That Uses the **read** Command

![[Pasted image 20241212141446.png]]

An **if ... then ... else ... fi** statement is used to check whether the argument **$1** exists. In the **then** statement, two commands are executed: an **echo** command that displays a message onscreen and a **read** command. The **read** command stops the script so that user input can be processed and stored in the variable NAME. So, the line **read NAME** puts all user input in the variable NAME, which will be used later in the script.
