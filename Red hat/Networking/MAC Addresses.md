IP addresses are the addresses that allow nodes to communicate to any other node on the Internet. They are not the only addresses in use though. 

- MAC addresses are important, though, because they help computers find the specific network card that an IP address belongs to.
- Each network card also has a 12-byte MAC address.
- MAC addresses are for use on the local network (that is, the local physical network or local WLAN, just up to the first router that is encountered)
- They cannot be used for communications between nodes that are on different networks

An example of a MAC address is 00:0c:29:7d:9b:17. Notice that each MAC address consists of two parts. The first 6 bytes is the vendor ID, and the second 6 bytes is the unique node ID. Vendor IDs are registered, and by using registered vendor IDs, it is possible to allocate unique MAC addresses.
