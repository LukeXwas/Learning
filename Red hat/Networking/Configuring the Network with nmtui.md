As suggested by the name, this tool provides a text-based user interface and can be started from a command-line terminal. Just run the **nmtui** command. With a console tool, you’d need to press TAB to switch between options and press the SPACEBAR or the ENTER key to select the highlighted option. 


The **nmtui** interface consists of three menu options:

- **Edit a Connection:** Use this option to create new connections or edit existing connections.
- **Activate a Connection:** Use this to (re)activate a connection.
- **Set System Hostname:** Use this to set the hostname of your computer.

The option to edit a connection offers almost all the features that you might ever need while working on network connections. It sure allows you to do anything you need to be doing on the RHCSA exam. You can use it to add any type of connection—not just Ethernet connections, but also advanced connection types such as network bridges and teamed network drivers are supported.

When you select the option Edit a Connection, you get access to a rich interface that allows you to edit most properties of network connections. After editing the connection, you need to deactivate it and activate it again.
