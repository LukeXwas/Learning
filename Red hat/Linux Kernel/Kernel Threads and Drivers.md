**Use of Kernel Threads and Drivers

The operating system tasks that are performed by the kernel are implemented by different kernel threads. Kernel threads are easily recognized with a command like ps aux. The kernel thread names are listed between square brackets.

Another important task of the Linux kernel is hardware initialization. To make sure that this hardware can be used, the Linux kernel uses drivers. Every piece of hardware contains specific features, and to use these features, a driver must be loaded. The Linux kernel is modular, and drivers are loaded as kernel modules

In some cases, the availability of drivers is an issue because hardware manufacturers are not always willing to provide open source drivers that can be integrated well with the Linux kernel. That can result in a driver that does not provide all the functionality that is provided by the hardware. If a manufacturer is not willing to provide open source drivers, an alternative is to work with closed source drivers. Although these make it possible to use the hardware in Linux, the solution is not ideal. Because a driver performs privileged instructions within the kernel space, a badly functioning driver may crash the entire kernel. If this happens with an open source driver, the Linux kernel community can help debug the problem and make sure that the issue is fixed. If it happens with a closed source driver, the Linux kernel community cannot do anything. But, a proprietary driver may provide access to features that are not provided by its open source equivalent.

To make it easy to see whether a kernel is using closed source drivers, the concept of the tainted kernel is used. A **_[tainted kernel](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/red-hat-rhcsa/9780138096311/gloss.xhtml#glos_261)_** is a kernel that contains closed source drivers. The concept of tainted kernels helps in troubleshooting drivers. If your RHEL kernel appears to be tainted, Red Hat support can identify it as a tainted kernel and recognize which driver is tainting it. To fix the problem, Red Hat might ask you to take out the driver that is making it a tainted kernel.
