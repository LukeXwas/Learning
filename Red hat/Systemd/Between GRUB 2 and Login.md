The loading of Linux depends on a temporary filesystem, known as the initial RAM disk. Once the boot process is complete, control is given to systemd, known as the first process.

After you select a kernel from the GRUB 2 configuration menu, Linux hands over boot responsibilities to the kernel with the help of the initial RAM disk, also known by its filename in the /boot directory, initramfs. As suggested by its name, it is actually a filesystem, but it is saved in a file rather than on a disk partition. During the boot process, Linux loads that temporary filesystem into your RAM. Lnux then loads hardware drivers and starts the first process, systemd.

Next, systemd activates all the system units for the initrd.target and mounts the root filesystem under /sysroot. Finally, systemd restarts itself in the new root directory and activates all units for the default target.
