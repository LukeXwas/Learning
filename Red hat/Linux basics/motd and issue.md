**/etc/motd and /etc/issue**
To display messages during the login process, Bash uses the /etc/motd and the /etc/issue files.

- **/etc/motd** - diplay after a user has successfully logged in to a shell. System administrators to inform users about an issue or a security policy.
- **/etc/issue** - The contents of this file display before the user logs in from a text-based console interface. Using this file provides an excellent means of specifying login instructions to users who are not logged in yet.
