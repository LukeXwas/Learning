When talking about storage, we use different measurement units.

- In some cases, units like megabyte (MB) are used. Megabyte is a multiple of 1,000
- In other cases, units like mebibyte (MiB) are used. Mebibyte is a multiple of 1,024.

**On current Linux distributions, the binary numbers (MiB, not MB) have become the standard.**
