If you make a misconfiguration to your file system mounts, the boot procedure may just end with the message “Give root password for maintenance.”
- This message is, in particular, generated by the **fsck** command that is trying to verify the integrity of the file systems in /etc/fstab while booting.
- If **fsck** fails, manual intervention is required that may result in this message during boot. Make sure that you know what to do when this happens to you!

If a device is referred to that does not exist, or if there is an error in the UUID that is used to mount the device, for example, Systemd waits first to see whether the device comes back by itself.
1. If that does not happen, it gives the message “Give root password for maintenance”. If that happens, you should by all means first enter the root password.
2. Then you can type **journalctl -xb** as suggested to see whether relevant messages providing information about what is wrong are written to the journal boot log.

3. If the problem is file system oriented, type **mount -o remount,rw /** to make sure the root file system is mounted read/write and analyze what is wrong in the /etc/fstab file and fix it.
