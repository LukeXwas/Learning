Docker is at the heart of the container ecosystem. However, the term _Docker_ can mean two things:

1. The Docker platform
2. Docker, Inc.

The _Docker platform_ is a neatly packaged collection of technologies for creating, managing, and orchestrating containers.

_Docker, Inc._ is the company that created the Docker platform and continues to be the driving force behind developing new features.

**The Docker technology**

The Docker platform is designed to make it as easy as possible to _build, ship,_ and _run_ containers.

At a high level, there are two major parts to the Docker platform:

- The CLI (client)
- The engine (server)

The _CLI_ is the familiar **`docker`** command-line tool for deploying and managing containers. It converts simple commands into API requests and sends them to the engine.

The _engine_ comprises all the server-side components that run and manage containers.
